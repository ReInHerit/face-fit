**Gamification** is the process of exploiting strategies and game dynamics into scenarios that are not a game. 
It has already been proved to be useful to enhance skills and competences in a variety of domains such as marketing, industry training and entertainment.
Also cultural heritage can benefit from a gamification approach which represents an opportunity to **engage visitors** to museums contents through the design of more entertaining, social and challenging digital learning scenarios, to help museums to move from the traditional “look and do not touch” toward a “play and interact” approach. 

Face-fit asks the user to replicate an artwork, concentrating on facial expressions that require a much more refined matching.
The application asks the users to replicate the pose of the head and the expression of some portraits by famous painters and transfer the face of the user on the artworks, generating a new image.
Face-fit can be used on mobile devices and in installations.

This app won a Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022, the foremost conference on multimedia.
